# openEHR Java API &nbsp; [![Stability: Experimental](https://masterminds.github.io/stability/experimental.svg)](https://masterminds.github.io/stability/experimental.html)

This project provides a collection of Maven packages that contain interface types and enum declarations for the corresponding openEHR specification.

## Overview

The openEHR specificiations are transpiled into the Java programming language as interfaces and enums.
(...) This approach is also known as Separate Abstractions pattern [1].
